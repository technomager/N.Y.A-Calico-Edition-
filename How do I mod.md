# Okay I have all of these mods and stuff, how do I actually put them in the list????

# How to…
Before getting started, it's best to learn the right way to mod. Skyrim is one of the few games where you can mod almost anything inside the game, but it's also one where it's complicated to get started. Even more when you start with a list of +1000 mods and you have no experience of how to mod it . I'll give you some advice that comes to mind, but it's also up to you and your own responsibility to search and learn how things work. I'm here to help and assist, but as soon as you start modding, know that you're on your own. That’s a reason why I’m going to give you some, I hope, useful advice. 


## 1. Mod Organizer 2 - MO2

MO2 is a great tool, and I'll let you discover all its features yourself. The most important thing to know is how panels work and how you're going to manage all your additions.

### Left Panel (Assets)
- The left panel is where you place your downloaded mods - no need to extract them, MO2 takes care of that for you. You can simply drag-and-drop your mod into the left-hand panel, or click the first button on the left. 
- The left panel is also there to manage conflicts between your assets or scripts, all the file types that the game will use. If one script conflicts with another, the one placed last will win! It's very important to take this into account, because the wrong order can cause you problems! (sometimes benign, of course)
- MO2 tells you which mods are in conflict, so you can double-click on them or just click on them to see which mods are involved.
- Create your own separators to manage your own additions, if you want to add more creature mods, then, place your mods below where Vermillion added them for NYA.
