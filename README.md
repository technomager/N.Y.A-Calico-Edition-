# N.Y.A Calico Edition
</p>

## Calico Edition is an Addon for Vermillion's N.Y.A NSFW Skyrim Modpack that aims to "Kinkify" the original List making it much more Submissive in gameplay. It is currently based of of N.Y.A 6.0.3

This addon removes certain aspects of the original N.Y.A that I personally considered 'Overpowered' or 'Dominant Focused' and replaced them with a slew of Raunchy, Horny and sometimes Mean mods.

## Disclaimers
 - <ins>**Calico Edition Does NOT SUPPORT UBE**</ins>

- Use of this Addon means you will no longer receive support from #nya-unmodified-support AND #nya-modding-general in the discord. if you need support check out #Calico-Support instead

- This Addon **Will** make your game extremely unstable do to the drastic increase in number of actions the game has to preform in the background. Practice Safe Saving and Fully Closing the game every few real life hours should help with any preformance issues

## To Those here very early
Thank you for taking an interest in my little addon your support means a lot. I am not ready for any testers at the moment but will do my best to notify others when I am. I am a solo dev working on this addon and I have a full time job so please give me a bit of patience while I figure everything out. I am learning as I am going, before working on this part in earnist I had never used most of the Skyrim toolbox or even how to fully use github. I do not work with computers for a profession.

if you want to talk to me about the list please do so in the Vermi's Hub [https://discord.gg/vermishub] assuming that Vermillion has set up proper channels to talk in.

## How To Install

1. Install all manual downloads, put them into your NYA downloads folder
2. Install .wabbajack File (Discord or in github)
3. Wabbajack UI, Browse Modlist, Install from disk
4. Point Wabbajack to original NYA download



# I Launched the Game, Now what?

1. First do the usual NYA startup
 
> Wait 15 seconds, do your skyrim unbound settings, make character*, then click stay here and wait for the original MCM recorder to finish, afterwards press enter and start your game

2. **Make sure to save!!!!!** you might crash on your first or second go around, but you signed up for a little jank
3. After a sucessful save find the "MCM Recorder" MCM and click on the Calico Edition Recording and follow the prompts. wait until it says the Recorder is complete
4. **Optional** Turn on Licenses (No Armor/Weapons in Cities), Soul Gem Oven (Pregnancy), and/or Sunhelm (Survival) in their respective MCMs
5. Check out the MCMs! I suggest looking into Devious Devices/Devious Curses MCMs to tweak them to your liking, by default they are set to be not extremely intrusive
6. Check out BaboDialog MCM to set you think your "Reletive Beauty stats" are for your character, people might talk...
