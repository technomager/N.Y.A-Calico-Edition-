# N.Y.A Calico Edition
</p>

## Calico Edition is an Addon for Vermillion's N.Y.A NSFW Skyrim Modpack that aims to "Kinkify" the original List making it much more Submissive in gameplay. It is currently based of of N.Y.A 6.0.3

This addon removes certain aspects of the original N.Y.A that I personally considered 'Overpowered' or 'Dominant Focused' and replaced them with a slew of Raunchy, Horny and sometimes Mean mods.

## To Those here very early
Thank you for taking an interest in my little addon your support means a lot. I am not ready for any testers at the moment but will do my best to notify others when I am. I am a solo dev working on this addon and I have a full time job so please give me a bit of patience while I figure everything out. I am learning as I am going, before working on this part in earnist I had never used most of the Skyrim toolbox or even how to fully use github. I do not work with computers for a profession.

if you want to talk to me about the list please do so in the Vermi's Hub [https://discord.gg/vermishub] assuming that Vermillion has set up proper channels to talk in.
